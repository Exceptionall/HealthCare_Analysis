# Healthcare Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The goal is to extract insights from the data to help improve healthcare services and decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Excel**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and preliminary analysis.
- **SQL**: To query and manage the database efficiently.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.

## Project Structure
- **Data**: Contains the source data files (Excel sheets, CSVs, etc.).
- **SQL Scripts**: Includes SQL queries used for data extraction and transformation.
- **Power BI Reports**: The main Power BI file (`HEALTHCARE.pbix`) containing the visualizations.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection**: Gather healthcare-related data from reliable sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Use Excel to clean and preprocess the data, removing any inconsistencies or errors.
3. **Database Setup**: Create a database using SQL Server and import the cleaned data.
4. **Data Analysis**: Write SQL queries to extract relevant information and analyze trends.
5. **Visualization**: Use Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visual representations of the analyzed data.
6. **Insights Generation**: Draw conclusions and insights from the visualizations to inform healthcare decisions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Microsoft Excel
- SQL Server (or compatible database system)
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop

## How to Use
- Open the Power BI file to explore the visualizations.
- Use filters and slicers to analyze different aspects of the healthcare data.
- Modify the SQL scripts to customize queries based on your specific needs.

## Summary
The healthcare dataset is processed and analyzed to uncover trends and patterns that can inform better healthcare practices. The project showcases the integration of Excel for data manipulation, SQL for efficient querying, and Power BI for creating interactive visualizations that facilitate data-driven decisions.
